### Ed Sheeran World Tour Fan App 

#### Project Overview:
This project is a class assignment where we developed a fan app for an artist on a hypothetical world tour. We chose to focus on Ed Sheeran, creating a fan app using R Shiny that provides essential information for fans attending his concerts at various stadiums across the world. The app is designed to enhance the concert experience by offering detailed information on amenities near each stadium, including restaurants, hotels, and local attractions.

#### Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate our ability to create a functional, real-world application using R Shiny. By simulating a fan app for a world-renowned artist like Ed Sheeran, we aimed to create a tool that could genuinely enhance the concert-going experience. This project allowed us to apply our skills in data visualization, web development, database management, and user experience design in a practical, engaging context.

#### Key Features:
- **Stadium Information:** The app includes a list of major stadiums where an artist of Ed Sheeran's might perform. The app will provide each stadium's details such as location, and other relevant information.
  
- **Nearby Amenities:** For each stadium, the app offers a curated list of nearby restaurants, hotels, and popular local attractions. This allows fans to plan their visit with ease, ensuring they have access to dining, accommodation, and entertainment options close to the concert venue.
  
- **Interactive Maps:** The app features interactive maps that show the location of each stadium and the surrounding amenities. Fans can explore the area visually and make informed decisions about where to eat, stay, and what to do before or after the concert.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using R Shiny, the app is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible to fans of all ages. The design is tailored to provide a seamless experience, allowing users to quickly find the information they need.

#### Technology Stack:
- **R Shiny:** For building the interactive web application.
- **HTML and CSS:** Used in conjunction with R Shiny to enhance the design and user experience.
- **SQL Database:** The data scraped from Yelp was stored in an SQL database to efficiently manage and query information related to the stadiums and nearby amenities.
- **Data Sources:** The data on restaurants, hotels, and attractions were scraped from Yelp using APIs.

#### Collaboration:
This project was a collaborative effort of 7 Columbia students, with each team member contributing to different aspects of the app's development, including data scraping, front-end design, back-end functionality, and database management.
