### Ed Sheeran World Tour Fan App 

ðŸ”—App Demo: https://vivianry.shinyapps.io/Ed_Sheeran_World_Tour_Fan_APP/

#### Project Overview:
This project is a class assignment where we developed a fan app for an artist on a hypothetical world tour. We chose to focus on Ed Sheeran, creating a fan app using R Shiny that provides essential information for fans attending his concerts at various stadiums across the world. The app is designed to enhance the concert experience by offering detailed information on amenities near each stadium, including restaurants, hotels, and local attractions.

#### Business Objectives:
The business objective of this project was to simulate the development of a real-world, user-centric application that could add value to the concert industry, particularly in terms of enhancing fan engagement and supporting the logistical challenges of attending large-scale events. The app also demonstrates how such a tool could be monetized through partnerships with local businesses, hotels, and restaurants, potentially serving as a valuable platform for sponsorship and advertising.

#### Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project was to showcase our ability to develop a user-focused, functional application using R Shiny that addresses both fan needs and business opportunities. By simulating an app for a world-renowned artist like Ed Sheeran, we explored how technology can be leveraged to improve customer experiences while creating new revenue streams for businesses operating in the event, hospitality, and entertainment sectors.

#### Key Features:
- **Stadium Information:** The app includes a list of major stadiums where an artist of Ed Sheeran's might perform. The app will provide each stadium's details such as location, and other relevant information.
  
- **Nearby Amenities:** For each stadium, the app provides a curated list of nearby restaurants, hotels, and local attractions. Through the interactive map, users can reserve restaurants, book hotels, and navigate to nearby entertainment venues, allowing fans to seamlessly plan their visit with access to dining, accommodation, and entertainment options near the concert venue.
  
- **Interactive Maps:** The app features interactive maps that show the location of each stadium and the surrounding amenities. Fans can explore the area visually and make informed decisions about where to eat, stay, and what to do before or after the concert.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using R Shiny, the app is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible to fans of all ages. The design is tailored to provide a seamless experience, allowing users to quickly find the information they need.

#### Technology Stack:
- **R Shiny:** For building the interactive web application.
- **HTML and CSS:** Used in conjunction with R Shiny to enhance the design and user experience.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** The data scraped from Yelp was stored in an SQL database to efficiently manage and query information related to the stadiums and nearby amenities.
- **Data Sources:** The data on restaurants, hotels, and attractions were scraped from Yelp using APIs.

#### Database Schema
